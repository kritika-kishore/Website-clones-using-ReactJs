# Website-clones-using-ReactJs

1. Stripe:
It's the clone of the welcome page of official website of Stripe (https://stripe.com/en-in). 
But instead of the dynamic colour change from the grid setup in the original, an svg has been used to mimic the effect.
It is just a frontend project without any active links. However, it can surely be repurposed for any real projects.
It's been created using ReactJS.

2. Bigbasket:
It's the clone of the welcome page of Bigbasket website home page (https://www.bigbasket.com/). It has a functional cart functionality. 
But again, there are no active links as of now. It is a complete frontend project with dynamic inputs at multiple places. 
These inputs can be refactored to be fetched from a backend database or an api in the future. But currently, these data are stored in categorized js files.
It's been created using ReactJS.
